Saving money and being frugal with your wages is extremely popular as people have less and less money these days after paying rent, mortgage, bills etc. Creating a frugal / save money blog can also be a big earner for you, especially if you choose a good angle to take on this niche. The following examples all have really good angles. They target a specific demographic and they create content that they will love, share and take action with. Those actions can make you money through affiliate links, Google Ads and coupons.</p><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 30px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><h3><a href="http://www.miss-thrifty.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miss Thrifty</a></h3><p>One of the more popular frugal blogs in the UK, Miss Thrifty is targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and articles. And rightly so! The market is massive and she‚Äôs meeting a need for this type of information. Young mums aren‚Äôt exactly rolling in cash. They may have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in, so the need to be more frugal with everyday living is a must.</p><p>The great thing about this blog is the conversational tone and the real person behind the brand. I think it‚Äôs inspiring to other mums to see someone like them making such a difference in other people‚Äôs lives by creating amazingly useful content that is 100% actionable. Also it may inspire mums to set up their own blog and to write about their experiences as a mother and a wife in the 21st century.</p><p><a href="http://www.miss-thrifty.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3139 lazyloaded" src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-1024x544.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="544" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-300x159.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-768x408.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-700x372.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty.jpg 1185w" data-ll-status="loaded" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3139" src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-1024x544.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="544" srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-300x159.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-768x408.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-700x372.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty.jpg 1185w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></noscript></a></p><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 30px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><h3><a href="https://skintdad.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skint Dad</a></h3><p>So when I talk about coming at a niche from a different angle, this example is exactly what I mean. Skint Dad is a site that helps young / new dads save money and be more frugal in their day to day living. There‚Äôs also a section on their that shows guys how to make a little more cash on top of their monthly day job wage, which is vital in some cases just to keep your head above water. &nbsp;A lot of new dads have the added stress of not having their wives‚Äô or girlfriends‚Äô wage coming in each month, due to&nbsp;the temporary career change in being a full time mum of a baby. So having some content around how they can make a few extra ‚ÄúPs‚Äù in their wallet each month, can ease the burden somewhat.</p><p><a href="http://skintdad.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3140 lazyloaded" src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-1024x521.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-1024x521.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-300x153.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-768x391.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-700x356.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad.jpg 1221w" data-ll-status="loaded" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3140" src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-1024x521.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-1024x521.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-300x153.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-768x391.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad-700x356.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad.jpg 1221w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></noscript></a></p><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 100px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><h2 style="font-size: 27px; color: #46b5fb; text-align: center;"><strong>Examples of Entreprenurship Blogs</strong></h2><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 30px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><h3><a href="https://solopreneurhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolopreneurHour.com</a></h3><p>A very well designed and slick blog that‚Äôs all about being your own boss and creating your own wealth.

The trick is to have your own take on tech and don‚Äôt just follow the trend. One area which hasn‚Äôt really been covered specifically is eco tech, so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.</p><p>Anyway, here‚Äôs a few blogs&nbsp;in the tech niche that I really like and that I feel are doing something different and is thriving when it comes to organic traffic increases and revenue.</p><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 30px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><h3><a href="https://knowtechie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knowtechie.com</a></h3><p><a href="https://knowtechie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3263" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20458'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="1024" height="458" data-lazy-srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-300x134.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-768x343.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-700x313.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie.jpg 1228w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-1024x458.jpg" /><noscript><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3263" src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-1024x458.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="458" srcset="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-300x134.jpg 300w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-768x343.jpg 768w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie-700x313.jpg 700w, https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></noscript></a></p><p>I‚Äôve been following this site since it started and has seen its progression from just one guy writing about stuff he loves, to a site that get‚Äôs decent traffic and has a team of writers.</p><p>Knowtechie is a great example of a site that started out as a hobby but has fast become a business.
